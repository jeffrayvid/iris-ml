Fine turning machine learning models on the famous Iris dataset

In this notebook, I created multiple ML models on the Iris dataset, 
to predict the type of flower based on the attributes of a given flower.

Below are the models included in the code (using sklearn):
-SVM with linear, rbf, polynomial, and sigmoid kernels
-Models were evaluated on the following classification measures:
 -accuracy
 -sensitivity
 -specificity
 -ppr
 -npr


Additionally, included in this notebook is a separate assignment using
KNN regression and SVM regression to build a model to predict credit default
